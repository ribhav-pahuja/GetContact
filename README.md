# GetContact
An android app that lets you get a contact from your phone when you've forgotten it at home.

<br>
This is a useful application when we forget our mobile and are desperately in need of a contact.
<br>
In this case, we can just send a name as a message from any mobile to our mobile where this application has been installed, here a key is specified for security.
<br>
After receiving this name, the mobile to which the message has been sent checks the contact list of the mobile and if that name is found, it sends the number to the mobile from where the mobile got the request.
